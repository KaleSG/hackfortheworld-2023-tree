                The purpose of our game is to show the unstoppable fight to save our earthâ€™s forests. Every day, reforestation organizations attempt to make change by re-establishing forest cover and restoring forest function. However, no matter the extent of their attempts, our rainforests are still being deforested. The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest in the world, covering over 5 million square kilometers across nine countries. Since 1988, an average of 10,000 acres of the Amazon has been destroyed every day. That equals out to an area the size of California. In 2021 alone, around 4.8 million acres of rainforest was lost. The main cause of these losses is the illegal deforestation problem. Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has hit its highest level in over 15 years. Between 1988 and 2004, an average of 20,000km of forest was cut each year.
